# Hospital-Appointment-System-And-Testing


We design a hospital system for this project.In this system you can;
-Register to the hospital system.
-Login as a doctor/or patient.
-Make/Cancel appointment.
-When a user register to the system, information about user is stored in text files for login.
(If User is doctor in doctor file, if user is patient in patient file)
-Doctors can cancel the appointment.
-Doctors are picking patient names based on their current patients.
-Patients can not make appointments earlier or equal to todayâ€™s date.
-If your appointment is today and after today passes your appointment will be automatically deleted.
-If you write your birthday older than 1904 your registration will not be accepted.
-If you switch the department when you are making an appointment doctor names will be change according to departments.
